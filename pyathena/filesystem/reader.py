"""Sequential reading of a file with parallel range reads ahead of the consumer."""

class ReadAheadStream(io.RawIOBase):
    """Sequential stream over a file that reads ranges ahead in parallel.

    The file is read in parts of ``part_size`` bytes with a range-read function,
    and up to ``max_parts`` parts are read in a thread pool ahead of the consumer,
    so the transfer is not limited to one request at a time. Parts are returned in
    order, and at most ``max_parts`` parts plus the one being consumed are held in
    memory. A read that returns fewer bytes than requested raises ``OSError``, and
    an error from the range-read function is raised by the read that reaches its
    part; every later read raises the same error.

    Closing the stream cancels the queued reads, waits for the running ones, and
    then calls ``on_close``.

    Example:
        >>> file = fs.open_input_file(path)
        >>> stream = ReadAheadStream(
        ...     lambda offset, size: file.read_at(size, offset), file.size(), on_close=file.close
        ... )
        >>> with pyarrow.PythonFile(stream, mode="r") as f:
        ...     table = pyarrow.csv.read_csv(f)
